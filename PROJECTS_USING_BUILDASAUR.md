# Projects Using Buildasaur

If you're using Buildasaur and you wouldn't get fired for admitting it, I'd be greatly honored if you could add the name of your project or team below. I like to think this could help spread the word, show more openness in our community and encourage new teams to try Xcode Server with Builda, thus staying on the safe and productive side. Thanks! :-)

- [Buildasaur](https://github.com/czechboy0/buildasaur), (04/2015-...), yes, Pull Requests in this repo are tested by a Builda running on my home Mac
- [SwiftKey for iOS](http://swiftkey.com/en/keyboard/ios/), (03/2015-...), the original workflow was custom built for our team

- (your team here, just fork the repo, add yourself and send a PR. Thanks for taking the time!)
